Task Time Tracker Syndicate - Hacking time, one task at a time

## Yo yo yo

So here's the deal – one day I coded myself a [Task Time Tracker](https://github.com/The-TTT-Syndicate/task-time-tracker-fsharp) just for personal use. But guess what? It sucked. So I made another one. Then my buddy was like, *"Man, I don’t know what to code..."* and I was like, *"Dude, just make a tracker!"* And he was like, *"Bet".* But will he actually do it? No clue... Just in case, I made this repo so he can drop his masterpiece here (if he ever finishes it). And hey, if **YOU** wanna join the squad, improve something, or drop your own spicy TTT, **welcome aboard!**
